# CDF Resilience Engineering SIG

## Overview
The Resilience Engineering SIG's goal is to create space to discuss practical
implementations of robust software development systems and resilient software
operations practices, with the aim of building a curated library of industry
examples. The RE SIG will document these examples largely via whitepapers proposing and describing tools, features, technical standards, guidelines, 
operational practices, and organizational design patterns which make it easier
for software development teams to create highly robust software development 
pipelines and software operations teams to operate that software in a
sustainably resilient manner. Case studies on how these concerns can leverage
and compliment each others' work and improve the engineering culture of the 
socio-technical systems in which they participate are also relevant.

Topics of interest include:

* Architecture - principles of design that are conducive of robustness and resilience
* Operational Practice - the role expertise plays in the operation of systems and methods to cultivate and nurture it 
* Disaster Recovery - creating adaptive, self-healing production systems
* Testing - Chaos engineering practices and other means to facilitate the ongoing practice of resilience
* Adaptive Capacity - methods and practices to create a reserve of capability and "slack" in a system for people and technology to be able to effectively adapt to unexpected circumstances
