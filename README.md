# CDF TOC

The role of the CDF Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) is to facilitate communication and collaboration among the Technical Projects. The TOC will be responsible for:

- coordinating collaboration among Technical Projects, including development of an overall technical vision for the community;

- making recommendations to the Budget Committee of resource priorities for Technical Projects;

- electing annually a chairperson to preside over meetings, set the agenda for meetings, ensure meeting minutes are taken and who will also serve on the Governing Board as the TOCâ€™s representative (the "TOC Representative");

- creating, maintaining and amending project lifecycle procedures and processes, subject to the approval of the Governing Board; and

- such other matters related to the technical role of the TOC as may be communicated to the TOC by the Governing Board.
