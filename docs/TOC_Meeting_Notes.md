-   Share any events/activities planned for October that would be
    > appropriate to promote as part of CDF Hacktoberfest.

        > [*https://github.com/cdfoundation/toc/issues/70*](https://github.com/cdfoundation/toc/issues/70)
        > -- whether or not the CDF should have a governance model for
        > SIGS in the foundation

        -   FD: as a SIG leader I was looking for some guidance on how
            > to run SIG, and I found nothing. I looked around and CNCF
            > had a lot more clarity here. So that brought me to this.

            -   KK: examples?

                -   FD: Eric from Puppet showed interest to join SIG. I
                    > was wondering how to go about it.

                -   Tara: Code of Conduct

        -   KK: my initial reaction is to find a groove and then capture
            > how we found ourselves running them

        -   Tara: is there anything we can think ahead now, thatâd
            > be nice. So any lessons, whether itâs from CNCF or from
            > others, would be valuable

            -   Tara: \[Iâll start with one\] donât let them linger if
                > one is dead.

        -   Tracy: thereâs CI ~~SIG~~WG in CNCF. Should we be involved
            > with that? Between two foundations I feel we have too many
            > of them.

            -   DLc: that SIG is to run CI service for the rest of CNCF.

            -   FD: Iâve been involved in CI WG @ CNCF so this
                > conversation is now ongoing

        -   &lt;&lt; Tara talks about her aspiration of interop
            > SIG &gt;&gt;

        -   Tracy: whatâs the difference between SIG and WG?

            -   Thereâs a definition. SIG is long running, WG is one off
                > task and be done.

            -   Tracy: I note that [*our
                > website*](https://cd.foundation/) doesnât list WGs.

                -   **DLz: Tara to file a foundation ticket at the

                > more than welcome to join if you are interested in
                > talking to those users & projects, outside the context

        -   Tara: shall we involve Keptn here? **AI: DLc to reach out**

    -   Call for end users to participate in panel discussion at CD
        > Summit Amsterdam \[DLc\]

        -   We want 4-5 of those to discuss the practices. If you know

            > needs infra support to help companies create PRs, and
            > review

            -   TOC should be responsible for this -- start with

        -   [*https://github.com/cdfoundation/toc/pull/26*](https://github.com/cdfoundation/toc/pull/26)

        -   **KK: letâs call a vote / Tara: +1 / Andy +1**

    -   Screwdriver update

        -   &lt;&lt; KK provided updates &gt;&gt;

    -   Create Roadmap

        -   Projects, priorities

        -   DLpz: Chris & I were talking about this, looking at how CNCF
            > did this roadmapping. Establish the area that we want to
            > attack â specs, conformance, etc. CDF should have
            > that, too.

            -   KK: challenge I had was to find projects with passionate
                > backers, as opposed to âwish list of things weâd love
                > to seeâ

            -   KK: if we frame this as âcall for projectsâ to clarify
                > what we are looking for, that might encourage people
                > out there to step up

            -   DLpz: I like Taraâs âreference architectureâ idea.

            -   Kay: There are some projects in CNCF that I think are
                > good fit for the CDF. Shouldnât we be talking with
                > them to have them come over?

                -   Kay had a specific project in mind

                -   Tara: maybe we look at the ecosystem map and that
                    > might give us the list

                -   KK: maybe we can start by giving more visibility and
                    > facilitate collaboration between CNCF projects and
                    > CDF projects/efforts.

                -   DLpz: Chris / Dan to discuss WG on cross-foundation
                    > collaboration

            -   Tara: Iâd like to see smoother migration from non-cloud
                > to hybrid cloud easier.

                -   KK: +1.

                -   Tara: this will help useful differentiation

                -   AG: I think âhybridâ is important. That prevents
                    > people from getting an impression that this is
                    > cloud vendorâs play

            -   KK: common format â e.g., test spec

            -   KK: call out more specific projects in the SDLC like
                > artifact manager, test frameworks, code coverage, etc.

            -   **Letâs form a WG so that we can get people to spend
                > their focused time brainstorming**

            -   KK: provisioning / Tara: environment management

                -   This happens all the time. This wheel is
                    > getting reinvented.

                -   New team comes onboard and DPE folks are trying to
                    > automate the setup of Jenkins, JIRA, K8s
                    > namespace, ...

    -   Matt: Do folks need help with CFP reviews or summit prep?

        -   Matt: Puppet is willing to help.

        -   DLpz: you should talk to Tracy Regan @ the outreach
            > committee

        -   DLpz: Iâm calling attention to the timing of CfP

            -   DLpz: Diversity, inclusion is getting worked on by the
                > GB, if you have thoughts, send it to me

            -   Attendance? Projects?

            -   KK: calling attention to diversity in terms of geos of
                > companies who participate. CDF participants are often
                > companies, not individuals.

            -   TH:

    -   AOB?

        -   Fatih: I have Q around TOC contributors. I read [*the
            > document*](https://github.com/cdfoundation/toc/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md).
            > Is that only for member companies?

            -   I issued a PR to add myself to this but no responses for
                > 3 weeks

            -   KK: letâs make sure these things donât go unnoticed

    -   Screwdriver next steps

        -   Tara: what Iâve heard is that the engagement with the

            > âcoming here for the sake of it.â It felt like a

        -   DLc: I share some of the same concerns with Tara

        -   KK: I suggest I drive a further conversation. I feel like
            > our goals are still aligned in terms of bringing
            > them onboard.

        -   Yoav/KK: thereâs a bit of chicken and egg problem. Others:

        -   Kay: I got a similar impression. The CDF is still new

        -   Tara: donât over emphasize development, and instead

            -   Be overt about those. Advertise them.

        -   We built this project in the hope itâs useful for others

        -   We wanted to build a system that involves no humans

        -   Used across the portfolio of VM companies

        -   Origin is 2012 at Yahoo

        -   Pipeline as Code

        -   Initially this was orchestrator on top of Jenkins, then we
            > hit the wall, so we rebuilt it

        -   We wanted to make sure it works at the scale of Yahoo

        -   The result of rewrite got open-sourced in 2016

        -   &lt;&lt; architecture diagram in the presentation &gt;&gt;

        -   Can use different âexecutorâ to actually carry out builds -
            > Docker, K8s, even Jenkins

            -   Better isolation based on HyperContainer

        -   Usage

            -   &lt;&lt; usage within VM in a slide &gt;&gt;

        -   Features - lots from http://cd.screwdriver.cd/

            -   Various PRs from outside

            -   Weekly sync between two companies appear the main

        -   **AI: DL: Iâm going to work on the other SIG like proposal**

        -   DL: I had the security delivery chain WG in mind

        -   The infra usage metrics collection stuff could be a good fit

        -   Any thought behind â3 member companiesâ bar?

            -   DL: Not too much, 2 could do, too

        -   DLz: we should be prescriptive of the communication channels

    -   CDF TOC Meeting Cadence? (every 2 weeks to start?)

        -   AGREED: 2 weeks same time of the week (2nd and 4th Tue at
            > 9am PT)

        -   DL: in person meetings where we can?

            -   Letâs pencil this in â AG: I havenât made my plan yet

            -   CA to look into logistics a bit

            -   CA: itâd be nice to have a face-to-face between CNCF &
                > CDF TOCs

    -   CDF TOC Values/Principles (see
        > [*doc*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s1vF0bEvlKk7bgra2-456eNU_uknZQ8l3HMc797ApJo/edit))

        -   People seem to be happy of the current version

        -   Next step: turn this into GitHub PR, a round of comments and
            > updates, and vote in the next TOC meeting.

        -   **[*DONE*](https://github.com/cdfoundation/toc/pull/2):
            > ACTION: Kohsuke to turn this into a PR**

    -   CDF TOC Project Acceptance Process (see
        > [*example*](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/bootstrap/blob/master/PROJECT_PROGRESSION.md)
        > and end of values document)

        -   CA: [*I added this starting point in the
            > doc*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s1vF0bEvlKk7bgra2-456eNU_uknZQ8l3HMc797ApJo/edit#heading=h.cqpstx8vnye0)

        -   DL: is the long queue in CNCF because of its process?

            -   CA: I donât expect that many projects in here

            -   AGREED: thatâs not a problem for us for now

        -   On maturity levels

            -   DL: there are implications of maturity levels to TOC
                > seats

                -   KK: having three stages help here â incubating &
                    > graduating projects are eligible for seats?

            -   What do different groups to during incubation

                -   Be on the treadmill toward the explicit graduation
                    > criteria

                -   CA: CDF DevStats:
                    > [*http://devstats.cd.foundation*](http://devstats.cd.foundation)
                    > is helpful

            -   AG: anything you donât recommend from copying CNCF?

                -   CA: if early stage project is important, just
                    > copy it. If not, we can cut that part out

                -   &lt;&lt; opinions seem to be favoring omitting
                    > sandbox &gt;&gt;

                -   Can be added later, but removing a box is harder

                -   KK: if we do without sandbox, there needs to be some
                    > adoption/maturity criteria for the incubating

            -   AGREED: omit sandbox for now. Two stages

            -   **Next step: add meat to those two stages.**

    -   FYI: First CDF GB meeting will be April 18th (GB will host TOC
        > election for their slots)

        -   CA: we expect GB to send us 3 more people. 2 slots left
            > âback-pocketedâ for new projects

            -   Election would probably take 2 weeks to run

        -   **CA: if we have candidates we want, we should propose that
            > to GB**

            -   CA: think about diversity inclusion.

            -   CA: end user representatives are valuable

            -   CA: we can also reach out publicly

            -   KK: letâs think about people we want here

        -   AG: how about staggered terms?

            -   CA: at CNCF we did a lottery to decide who gets 1 year &
                > 2 year to create staggers. This will happen after GB
                > sends the rest of people

    -   Q&A

        -   DL: CDF Summit quick update (co-located with
            > Kubecon Barcelona)

            -   4 overviews from each projects in the morning

            -   Panels in the afternoon being planned

            -   200 capacity. 90+ has already signed up.

            -   [*Link to the planning

        -   AG: whatâs the expected updates to projects?

            -   CA: No need to change package names, namespaces, etc

            -   CA: website update expected.

        -   TC: Jenkins team will have a meeting with LF infra team.
            > Would Spinnaker folks be interested in aligning?

            -   CA: letâs discover what the needs are

            -   AG: I think about Travis, Artifactory, Discourse, Slack,
                > â¦

            -   CA: Letâs collect requirements. Letâs start Google Doc
                > and throw things in there to start with

                -   **TC: Iâll start the doc & add Jenkins stuff here**

                -   CA: this would be a good place to also list up
                    > assets slated for transfer

    -   ACTIONS

        -   (see 4 action items above, bold lined)

        -   CA: any budget related things, let me know before the first
            > GB meeting

            -   CA: we prefer projects to come with specific asks

            -   Letâs get baseline of whatâs being spent today

        -   CA: we are looking to hire somebody as âprogram managerâ

        -   DONE: Dan to turn the invite into recurring

        -   DONE: CA to setup Zoom & recording
